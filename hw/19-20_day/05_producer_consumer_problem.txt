It's mainly used for multi-process/multi-thread synchronisation
when there's a bounded buffer (with fixed size). Producers
shouldn't produce when the buffer is full and the consumers
shouldn't consume when the buffer is empty. When the buffer is
full, the producer processes/threads are blocked, which is more 
efficient than having to constnatly check the buffer size. When 
the buffer is empty, the consumer processes/threads are blocked
